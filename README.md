# The Classification project - Titanic Dataset

## Description:
This project is about predicting the survivals of the titanic dataset using machine learning models. Initially, the project starts with importing the train.csv file. Then, the model is trained with different classifiers to determine the passenger's survival. Finally, the accuracy and recall of the model are improved to increase the prediction probability.
